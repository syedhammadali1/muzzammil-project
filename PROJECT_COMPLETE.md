## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Open the Application
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation or server required!

### 2. Set Up Google Maps (Optional)
- Get a Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Open `index.html`
- Find line 157: `<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY...`
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key
- See `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

**Note:** The application works without the API key, but the map will use Leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap) as a fallback.

### 3. Create Word Documents
- Open each `.txt` file in the `docs/` folder
- Copy the content
- Paste into Microsoft Word
- Format and save as `.docx` with the filename matching the school name
- Place all `.docx` files in the `docs/` folder

See `docs/README_DOCUMENTS.txt` for detailed instructions.
